                <b>Early Years (1950s)</b>
                <p>The origins of F1 lie in European Grand Prix racing, which dates back to the 1920s and 1930s. After World War II, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) established the Formula 1 regulations in 1946, which laid the foundation for the sport we know today. The first Formula 1 World Championship took place in 1950, consisting of seven races, including the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix and the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Italian teams, particularly Alfa Romeo, dominated the early years, with Giuseppe Farina becoming the first-ever World Champion in 1950. However, it was Argentina's Juan Manuel Fangio who became the dominant force, winning five world championships between 1951 and 1957, a record that stood for decades.</p>

                <b>The 1960s: Innovation and British Dominance</b>
                <p>The 1960s saw the rise of British teams, with Lotus, BRM, and Cooper leading the charge. The mid-engine car design, pioneered by Cooper, revolutionized the sport and became the standard. Lotus, led by the innovative Colin Chapman, introduced aerodynamic concepts such as wings and ground effects, which helped transform the sport into the high-speed, technology-driven competition it is today. Jim Clark, driving for Lotus, became one of the standout drivers of the decade, winning two world championships in 1963 and 1965.</p>

                <b>The 1970s: Safety and Commercialization</b>
                <p>The 1970s marked a turning point for F1 in terms of safety and commercialization. Tragic accidents in previous decades had exposed the dangers of the sport, leading to significant improvements in car and track safety. Drivers like Jackie Stewart campaigned for better safety measures, and his influence led to changes that saved countless lives. The decade also saw the rise of major commercial sponsorships, transforming F1 into a business as much as a sport. Ferrari, McLaren, and Tyrrell became dominant teams during this period, with Niki Lauda and Emerson Fittipaldi emerging as iconic champions.</p>

                <b>The Turbo Era (1980s)</b>
                <p>The 1980s witnessed the rise of turbocharged engines, which brought unprecedented power to F1 cars. Renault was the first team to introduce turbo engines in 1977, and by the early 1980s, most teams had followed suit. The rivalry between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became a defining feature of this era, with both drivers winning multiple world championships. This period also saw the dominance of McLaren and Williams, two of the most successful teams in F1 history. Senna, in particular, became a legend, known for his incredible speed and fierce competitiveness.</p>

                <b>The Modern Era (1990s – Present)</b>
                <p>The 1990s saw Michael Schumacher rise to prominence, eventually becoming one of the greatest drivers in F1 history. Schumacher won seven world championships, five of them with Ferrari, making him the most successful driver of all time until Lewis Hamilton equaled his record in 2020. During the 2000s and 2010s, technology continued to evolve, with hybrid engines and advanced aerodynamics becoming central to F1. The introduction of KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) and DRS (Drag Reduction System) in the 2010s aimed to improve overtaking and create more exciting races.</p>
